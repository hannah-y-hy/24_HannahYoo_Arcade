1-sentence description for this game: Eliminating all the stars(including randomly respawning ones) in 3 min, at the Supermario-like gamefield 

<Task list>
**minimal core things first**

Task 1. Basic Game field settings
    Step 1. Sprite sheets animations for idle state
        Step a. Search for appropriate game object assets
                e.g: player's default(idle) animattion: hovering 
        Step b. Make some pixel art icons if there's nothing suitable
    Step 2. basic settings for sprites
        Step a. adding components like RigidBody 2D, Box collider 2D, etc


Task 2. Making 3-min timer
    Step 1. UI elementsfor timer
        Step a. make TextMeshPro thing for timer
    Step 2. timer operation logic in GameManager script


Task 3. Movements for gameobjects
    Step 1. Setting up player's movement according to joystick(or just keyboard keys for now)
        step a. Input.GexAxis() code that reacts to keyboard's left and right arrow keys
    Step 2. Setting up player's movement according to right & left button
        step a. left button down == player jump
        step b. Green button down == player jump a bit higher


<DevLog>

10/26
Current task: making researches on what I need to learn
    Googling to figure out whether it's possible to make timer gameobjets to deide active/inactive state of the game
        ->I guess this kind of logic is available in game manager script
        referred developer blogs (Kor): 1) https://velog.io/@slow_cosmos/Unity-%ED%83%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%A8%B8-%EA%B5%AC%ED%98%84
                                        2)(super basic recap of DeltaTime):https://www.engedi.kr/unity/?bmode=view&idx=3709777

    Figuring out whether there's any efficient way to make tile/block based 2D game
        ->Tile palette: somthing that helps tile based gmae field design
            --> I might wanna search for some video tutorials about this
                                

10/27
Current task: Recap on 10/24's class & a bit more researches
    Started drawing UX flowchart in Freeform but has only a couple of screen images( default & game start)
    Going over canvas announcement on 10/24's class : https://mica.instructure.com/courses/17324/assignments/121419
    Making some notes on FreeForm about methods that I might wanna use in this projects


10/29
* Personally, just drawing a flowchart didn't work out well, so I decided to make a tile map a little bit for a better ideation on user experience ideas.
Current task: Gathering some gmae objest assets
            & Setting up tile map palette
    Unity Doc about the tile map thing (KOR): https://docs.unity3d.com/kr/2021.3/Manual/class-Tilemap.html
    + Developer's blog that I referred (KOR): https://velog.io/@ohjh1744/%EC%9C%A0%EB%8B%88%ED%8B%B02D-%ED%83%80%EC%9D%BC%ED%8C%94%EB%A0%88%ED%8A%B8-%ED%83%80%EC%9D%BC%EB%A7%B5-%EB%AC%BC%EB%A6%AC%EC%A0%81%EC%9A%A9-%EB%B3%B5%ED%95%A9-%EC%BD%9C%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EB%8D%94-2D
        just learned that there is some special kind of tile map that called 'Rule tile'
        -> Unity Doc (Kor): https://unity.com/kr/how-to/create-art-and-gameplay-2d-tilemaps-unity
        * But TBH setting up rules in that component seems to be too complicated so I'm not really sure whether I'm gonna use that 


10/30 and a bit more before 10/31's class
Current task: kind of playing with Gameobjects & tile map for specified UX plans
    * Just made some simple player & coin objects for this
    Opened FreeForm drawing tool and planning & drawing player's movements accoring to the joystick's movement
    Thinking about what I could do with red & Green buttons on the arcade machine: maybe jump and appearance change of player gameobject?
    Still drawing & googling some methods to make certain UX available


10/31 In-class work session
Partner from now on: Phoebe
<Setting priority tasks after talking with Doc Stegman >
    #1: Making core things
        -> maybe just walking by using left&right arrow keys for now
        -> and then jumping
    #2: Suber basic gamefield settings
        -> prefab-based gamefield (NOT TILEMAP)
        --> right now: going over Unity Docs about prefabs right now: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingPrefabs.html

- Current task (Before Lunch): Making basic player movements in Player.cs 
- Current task (After Lunch): Setting up basic gamefield
    <Some notes about current GameManager script>
    (The script that is related to star gameobjects):
         - Making the stars resapwning till the player collides(eliminates) certain number of stars
            --> **So this game would be like eliminating all the stars(including respawning ones) in 3 min**
         - "StarsCollected < 5" : if player collects(=collides and eliminates) 5 stars, the stars won't be respawned anymore
            --> but we might wanna heighten this value later â€” we'll see
         - "NewPos" : new position that new star
         - Star respawning rate: initially, it was set to 1 sec but we could set that time to random second or something
         - How to assign controller keys for player(ghost)'s movement: If we go to the inspector panel of player(ghost) gameobject, there would be super long list of available keys under the 'Player script' component
         
<Next task I might wanna do>
1. setting up 3-min timer thing on the upper-right side of the screen
2. making game over logic that works then the player encounters 3-min time limit
3. writing script for borders: I just made some transparent rectangle gameobjects that could work as border lines to prevent the player flying out of the screen, but I just had no time to write script for them 
 

11/7 in-class work session
current task: fixing minor bugs
    just realized that ther's some trouble wih 'IsGrounded' method and I think ith makes the camera to fly away, which I don't want.
    & it seems like a matter of lacking information on checking points. maybe I might wanna use another method instead.

*First things first*

- Plans for timer: I might wanna make the basic function by legacy text and then make another fancy stuff
Making some researches
1) how to convert int to float when making a timer: https://discussions.unity.com/t/converting-a-float-to-a-int-countdown-timer-c/499196/3
