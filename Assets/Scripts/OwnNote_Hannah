10/31, In-class work session
    Just learned that we could use z axis to flip player gameobject

11/07, Some notes about ray casting
    reason why we set z value to 0 in 2D games: we want things to collide. if certain GOs have diffrent z values, thry aren't gonna collide.
- super basic components when we wanna make some movements(physics?): sprite renderer, collider 2D, rb2D
    * FYI thing- Primative colliders: made of vertex
        vertex: tiny little dots around the collider
- super basic components when we wanna make some collision on certain GO: collider 2D, rb2D
- Difference beween 3 linear stuff in Unity
1. Vector: has value
2. Ray: infinite to 1 side (but we cna give it a ending point)
3. Line: infinite to both sides
- Explosion(): a method that is realted to Ray casting
    how do we use this method in ray casting?: by conditional statement(If/else...)
        e.g.: Update()
                {
                if(true)
                {
                    Explosion()
                }
                }

- Ray casting: same as cllider but we decide the colliding point(?)
    e.g.: we can make some colliders on the screen and tell the ray to do run Explosion() when the ray hits certain collider
        ==something like a radar - IFKYK
- Using bool in ray casting example:
    Raycas+2D()
    {
        bool hit;
        return hit;
    }
- Parameters that RayCas method need: 1)Starting point, 2)Direction (and also we can do leangth if we want. if we don't set that, it's gonna be infinite. leangth is like setting a ending point)
    1) Starting point: vector 2(x and y party). we're settiong a position, like setting a point
    2) Direction 
- Ray casting: has 11 differnt versions so we might wanna use one of them
- what we could do in conditional statement of ray casting: 
- 'CheckCircle' method: this is a method that checks everything in circular direction 


11/14: How to modify input manager for an archade machine
- Some components that I might wanna set in input manager panel
Type: "Joystick axis". this is originally set as keyboard something
Joy Num:Joystick 1 or 2 or something. The first joystick that you connect to the computer first would be joystick 1.

    *If I have 2 players, I should make seperate "Horizontal" & " Vertical" for each players.
    e.g.: Horizontal player 1 + Vertical player 1 & Horizontal player 2 + Vertical player 2

Positive Button: I should fill this thing since it's a must-do thing
                e.g.: joystick 1 button 0, or joystick 1 button 0, or something like that.
